# Loan-prediction-Model

Based on the dataset and model evaluation:

● The Random Forest model effectively predicts loan approval with high accuracy on both
training and testing sets.

● Training accuracy and test accuracy is 1.0 and 0.756 respectively.

● The Random Forest model accurately predicts loan approval on both training and testing
datasets.

● Key factors influencing loan approval include the applicant's income, loan amount, and
credit history.

● Properly handling missing values and encoding categorical variables are essential for
preparing the data for modeling.

● The confusion matrix helps assess the model's performance by displaying true positives,
true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

● Created a Tableau dashboard using a given dataset.

● The tableau dashboard helps in visually understanding the data and to get multi faceted
view of the data for better understanding.
